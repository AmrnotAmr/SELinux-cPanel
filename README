This is an open source project to develop SELinux modules for cPanel and it's services in order for SELinux to be compatible with cPanel/WHM installations. This is mainly to prove to cPanel that it can be done and in a fairly feasible fashion.

If you'd like to contribute in any way, we'd love the help!

Here are some recommended tools to get started:

[cPanel's installation guide]
http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/InstallationGuide/

It should be noted that you should not install cPanel on a server that has already been configured. It's highly invasive with it's changes to your server's configuration. My personal configuration was to create a virtual machine with KVM specifically for this project.

The SELinux packages that must be installed are:

	libselinux.x86_64 : SELinux library and simple utilities
	libselinux-static.x86_64 : Static libraries used to build SELinux
	libselinux-utils.x86_64 : SELinux libselinux utilies
	selinux-policy.noarch : SELinux policy configuration
	selinux-policy-mls.noarch : SELinux mls base policy
	selinux-policy-targeted.noarch : SELinux targeted base policy
	checkpolicy.x86_64 : SELinux policy compiler
	libsemanage.i686 : SELinux binary policy manipulation library
	libsemanage.x86_64 : SELinux binary policy manipulation library
	policycoreutils.x86_64 : SELinux policy core utilities
	policycoreutils-python.x86_64 : SELinux policy core python utilities
	setools.x86_64 : Policy analysis tools for SELinux
	setools-console.x86_64 : Policy analysis command-line tools for SELinux
	setroubleshoot.x86_64 : Helps troubleshoot SELinux problems
	setroubleshoot-server.x86_64 : SELinux troubleshoot server
	checkpolicy.x86_64 : SELinux policy compiler
	policycoreutils.x86_64 : SELinux policy core utilities
	policycoreutils-python.x86_64 : SELinux policy core python utilities

These packages can get you started on SELinux policy creation, modification, compilation and troubleshooting.

Please feel free to send me a message or make an issue with any inquiries.

Thanks,
